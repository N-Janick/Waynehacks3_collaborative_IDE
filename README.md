Our project for WayneHacks3 is to create a collaborative coding platform aimed at education.

Problem:
Nick works as a supplemental instruction leader for Introduction to program development and design at Macomb Community College. One common issue that he ran into was when holding remote sessions it was difficult for students to work collaboratively on the same piece of code when they were in 2 different physical locations. They could share screens, but when pairing up to write code only one person is editing the file. We aim to solve this and create a more collaborative environment but creating a platform where you can meet with others and edit the same fle simultaneously.

We will be building a desktop app using java, as that is the tool that we are both most comfortable with currently.

Initial delivarable will be just a collaborative text editor where multiple people can edit the file at the same time similar to google docs.

Stretch goals:
- set up server.
- add simple IDE features, such as color coding key words and variables.
- containerized interpreter on the server so code can be run and outputs sent to the client.
- text chat
- video chat
- create crossplatform functionality (mobile app, web app)
